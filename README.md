# CS360-Port

This app was developed to give users a straightforward, motivational tool for tracking their daily weight, setting goals, and receiving alerts when they reach milestones. It primarily targets fitness enthusiasts and individuals with health-related goals, addressing their needs by helping them track progress over time while keeping them engaged through visual feedback and reminders.

To create a user-centered experience, I designed four main screens: Login, Main, Input, and Notifications. Each screen prioritizes ease of use, simplicity, and clarity. For example, the Main screen displays weight metrics and history in a grid layout, clearly visualizing progress. Design choices, such as button placement and background images, were made to keep users motivated and enhance usability, making the app a valuable daily tool.

In the coding phase, I broke the project into manageable tasks, starting with the user interface setup and gradually adding functionality. Techniques like using resource strings with placeholders streamlined the development process, improving both efficiency and maintainability. These methods will be particularly valuable in future projects as they save time and reduce errors.

While the app's screens were operational, it didn't function fully as intended. Some features didn’t work as expected, affecting the overall user experience. Despite this, it was valuable to see that the layout and navigation were intact, which provided a solid foundation for addressing the remaining issues. With further testing and debugging, I’m confident those functionalities can be enhanced.

One significant challenge was creating a visually engaging user interface that maintained functionality across various screen sizes. I had to innovate by experimenting with layout constraints to ensure adaptability. My focus on responsive design proved successful, as it demonstrated a practical application of my coding and design skills while effectively addressing core user needs.
